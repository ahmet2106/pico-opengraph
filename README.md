# Pico OpenGraph Plugin

This plugin is for the Flat-File-CMS [Pico](http://picocms.org/), and
is __Version 1.0-compatible__!

## use

* Copy the `PicoATOpenGraph.php` File to the `plugins` folder in the root of your Pico Project.

* Copy the below configuration array in your `config/config.php`

    ```
    //PicoATOpenGraph Configuration
    $config['PicoATOpenGraph'] = array(
        'enabled' => true,
        'defaultImage' => 'path/to/default/image.jpg'
    );
    ```
* Set your default image path as a backup when images cannot be found on a page

## what it does

This Plugin is enabling the [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/) to your site the right way. The front-page is mentioned as a "website" object, every sub-page as an "article". So in meta properties like:

* **og:type** website or article, mentioned as above.
* **og:title** the title of each of your content files
* **og:description**  the description of each of your content files
* **og:url** the url generated by base url and actual url
* **og:site_name** the site name set in config
* **og:image** if the article has an image so it takes the first image of each article

only if the requested site exists (not 404).

## notes

This Plugin was coded at 5 in the morning only to test the [Plugin API of Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/docs.html#plugins), so maybe it has some bugs - but..

**Fixed some?** Feel free to push a request ;)
